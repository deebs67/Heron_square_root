# Heron_square_root
Implementation(s) of the iterative square-root calculation method due to Heron ('Hero') of Alexandria.

We have implemented the algorithm as a Console application in the Csharp language, with default
values of an area of 10.0 and 10 iterations. Hand-hack the source file 'Program.cs' to change these
values.
